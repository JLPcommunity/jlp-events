#JLPDev: Let's Learn Flow-Based Programming

For computer/IT students, programmers, developers, coders, and engineers: Let's learn, code, and hack together! This meetup is for people in technology field. Please be noticed that this event is 100% technical talks and will be heavily around web application development. Audience is expected to know at least the basics of programming.

*Hello, programmers!*

We're ready to announce our 5th meetup about flow-based programming. Along with that, the Join Force of Developers Initiative is still active but now only directed for communications and insights. So there is no more mashup meetup. But aside, we're still supporting other communities to thrive and grow through various insights we have as a community platform.

*What would we talk about?*

The core content is about introduction to flow-based programming (FBP), practical usage, and its implementation that is ready for any of us to have. Because there is only a handful of FBP implementation that yet easy to use, we chose to go with just NoFlo and Flowhub. Although if you discovered other stuffs, feel free to share with us!

FBP is a particular form of dataflow (DF) programming and software development paradigm where applications are built as networks or nodes of systems and processes. Those exchange data across predefined connections by message passing, where the connections are specified externally to the processes. FBP is also naturally a component-based software engineering (CBSE) to be said, because we can use various reusable components inside the graph. FBP is actually quite old despite its recent buzz. Short story short, the dataflow programming was came up in the late 1960, then FBP was invented in the early 1970s, later the FBP discussion was rather just starting to began since 2010.

Programming in FBP is kinda similar on how we're modeling data flow in software. Moreover, if you have ever seen or use Quartz Composer, it's also like FBP.

NoFlo is an implementation of flow-based programming for JavaScript running on both Node.js and the browser. It's a visual control flows for JavaScript (http://noflojs.org). While Flowhub --based on NoFlo-- is a peer-to-peer full-stack visual programming for your finger (https://flowhub.io). Flowhub is a NoFlo IDE powered by Polymer Web Components.

Some real world products that implemented with FBP are:
* "The Grid" is a website creation powered by artificial intelligence. Simply put, AI websites that design themselves. (https://thegrid.io)

*Why we want or need to learn it?*

We want to discover another way or new approach to program an application. FBP allows us to think in streams (or so called flows) of data. We can easily plug or input various kinds of data sources. Because FBP is using components, the required elements are interchangeable based on our needs. FBP has a very collaborative on how we program together.

Specific to NoFlo, we chose it also because it has a lot of ready-made component libraries we can use directly. Moreover, NoFlo has a nice user interface (UI). Flowhub is the official web interface for NoFlo that is available for free to everyone.

*How are we going to do it?*

The meetup format will be more into short technical talk and actual practice.

The agenda are:

1. Short introdcation to FBP
2. A bit of live programming video demo
3. Access and use NoFlo and Flowhub
4. Run the platform and app
5. Free discussion and networking

The recommended required tools and skills are:

1. Your own laptop
2. A POSIX-compatible OS, like Linux or Mac
3. Ability to use terminal with shell
4. Some familiarity with command line tools
